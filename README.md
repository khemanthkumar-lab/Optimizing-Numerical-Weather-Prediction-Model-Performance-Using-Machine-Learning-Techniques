1. Introduction
Weather forecasting involves predicting weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall) for specific locations. With advancements in technology, machine learning offers an approach to forecast weather by learning patterns from historical data, which is crucial for areas like agriculture, disaster management, and daily activities.

2. Objective
This project aims to use machine learning to predict precipitation levels based on weather features. By employing Linear Regression and Decision Tree algorithms, the project seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of weather forecasting.

3. Methodology
The project is based on supervised learning, training a model on labeled weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) to predict precipitation levels. By analyzing past weather data, the model provides precipitation predictions for new inputs.

4. System Requirements
Software Requirements
Operating System: Windows
Programming Language: Python 2.7 or higher
