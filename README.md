## Introduction
Weather forecasting involves predicting weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall, for specific locations. With advancements in technology, machine learning offers an approach to forecast weather by learning patterns from historical data, which is crucial for areas like agriculture, disaster management, and daily activities.

## Objective
This project aims to use machine learning to predict precipitation levels based on weather features. By employing Linear Regression and Decision Tree algorithms, the project seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of weather forecasting.

## Methodology
The project is based on supervised learning, training a model on labeled weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) to predict precipitation levels. By analyzing past weather data, the model provides precipitation predictions for new inputs.

## System Requirements
## Software Requirements
- Operating System: Windows
- Programming Language: Python 2.7 or higher
- IDE: PyCharm
## Hardware Requirements
- RAM: Minimum 4GB
- Processor: Intel i3 or better
- Storage: Minimum 500GB Hard Disk

## Algorithms Used
## Linear Regression
A simple model that captures the relationship between numerical features (temperature, humidity, pressure) and the target variable (precipitation).

## Decision Tree
A tree-based algorithm that splits data based on feature values, suitable for both classification and regression tasks. This project uses it for regression.

## Project Steps
- Data Collection: Collection of historical weather data.
- Feature Selection: Selection of key features like maximum temperature, mean humidity, and pressure.
- Model Building: Construction of Linear Regression and Decision Tree models.
- Training: Training the models with historical weather data.
- Testing & Prediction: Prediction of precipitation using new weather inputs.
- Optimization & Comparison: Comparison of model performance for optimal accuracy.

## Results
The model predicts precipitation levels based on features such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. Visualizations show trends over time and relationships between features and precipitation.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to forecast precipitation. By analyzing historical data and applying Linear Regression and Decision Tree models, the system offers a more efficient approach to weather prediction, benefiting fields like agriculture, transportation, and disaster management.
